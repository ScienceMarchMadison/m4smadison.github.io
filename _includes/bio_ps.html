                Dr. Sondel’s career has focused on basic, translational and clinical cancer immunotherapy since beginning lab-studies in 1969. He completed both undergraduate (1971) and Ph.D. degrees in Genetics (1975) at UW, with guidance from Bone Marrow Transplant pioneer, Fritz Bach, M.D. With additional lab training in cancer immunology at the Dana Farber Center, he received his M.D. magna cum laude in 1977 from Harvard Medical School. Following residencies at the Universities of Minnesota and Wisconsin, he joined the UW faculty in 1980, and served as Head of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant from 1990 – 2016, and has helped lead the cancer immunology research effort at the UW Carbone Cancer Center since 1990. His laboratory has pursued several strategies for enabling immune responses to impact on cancer, and some have moved into clinical testing in children through the Children’s Oncology Group (COG), and some in adults at the UW Carbone Cancer Center, with some demonstrating clear clinical benefit. He has held multiple national committee and leadership roles, including at The National Institutes of Health, The American Cancer Society, The Children’s Oncology Group, The National Cancer Institute, and St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital. He has been a scholar of the Leukemia Society of America and recently received a 7-year Outstanding Investigator Award from the National Cancer Institute. He has published more than 370 scientific articles and chapters, and has trained more than 60 graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in his lab.
