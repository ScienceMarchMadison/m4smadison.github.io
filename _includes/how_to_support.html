    Scientific research requires funding, and so does the March for Science.

    Organizing the Madison March for Science is rewarding, but it isn't cheap. Expenses such as permit fees, event insurance, street closures, providing security, and rerouting transit during the event can add up. Event insurance alone costs 34 cents per attendee. We estimate the total cost of the march to exceed $10,000.
